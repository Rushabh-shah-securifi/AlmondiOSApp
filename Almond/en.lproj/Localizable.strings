<center><img src=h_dashboard.pdf/></center>
<p> At a glance, you can see recent smart home and Wi-Fi device notifications, how many network and smart devices are active, and also set your Almond to Home or Away mode with a quick tap.</p>
<center><img src=h_dashboard_selectals.pdf/></center>
<p>
If you own more than one Almond, you can quickly switch between them by tapping on the device’s name above the mode control, and picking another Almond from the list.

<h3>Scenes</h3>
<p>
Scenes make controlling multiple smart devices easier and faster. For example, when you go to bed you might have two or three lights to turn off, the temperature on the thermostat to adjust, and an alarm clock to set. A scene means you can do all of them with a quick tap.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes.pdf/></center>
<p>
You can create and manage scenes from the Scenes tab in the Almond app. Tap the + button to create a scene and then tap on a device and select one or more actions from the available options. Repeat this process for as many devices as you need and then tap on “Save”. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete creating your scene.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes_action_button.pdf/></center>
<p>
To manage a scene, tap on the quick action icon to activate the scene, and tap the options icon to change the devices in the scene and rename it.
</p>
<center><img src=h_manage_scenes.pdf/></center>
<p>
A scene might appear to be active even if you haven’t activated it. That is because a scene is set to active whenever all the actions that make up that scene are turned on. For example, using the scene above, you may have decided to adjust the lights and thermostat over the course of the evening. In doing so you matched the functions in the scene and it registers as activated.
</p>
<p>
Now, Almond scenes can be activated using Alexa. To begin using Alexa with Almond scenes, activate the Almond skill on Alexa. If you are prompted to rename a scene, choose one from the list of suggestions that comes up. These names are easiest for Alexa to understand.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes_alexa.pdf/></center>
<p>
Once you have renamed a scene, you will see a small Alexa icon on the scene’s tile on the Almond app. When finished, to activate a scene, you could say “Alexa, tell Almond to activate Outside Lights Off!” Where ‘Outside Lights Off’ is the name of the scene.

<h3>Tips For Setting Up Home Security</h3>
<p>
With the appropriate sensors, you can use an Almond 2015, an Almond+, or an Almond 3 to create a robust and powerful DIY home security system. Almond devices support a wide range of sensors from various manufacturers including Securifi. There is a full list here: <a href=\"https://www.securifi.com/sensors\">https://www.securifi.com/sensors</a>.
</p>
<p>
With Almond, you can build your Home Security using rules and the Almond modes: Home and Away.
</p>
<center><img src=h_setting_home_security.pdf/></center>
<p>
The modes work similar to arming and disarming your car alarm or home security system. With Almond though, you don’t need to do this yourself every time. Use our rules engine to automate this process using your WiFi presence.
</p>
<center><img src=h_rules_engine.pdf/></center>
<p>
For example, you could create rules like “If Matt’s iPhone, Dana’s iPhone and Katie\’s iPod disconnect from Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Away” and “If my iPhone joins Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Home” to automatically change the mode when you and your family leave home and when you come back.
</p>
<center><img src=h_rules_automation.pdf/></center>
<p>
You can then add another rule to make sure the alarm is sounded. For example, \“If Almond mode is Away, and a door is opened, sound alarm.\”
</p><p>
Experiment with Rules to build your own scenarios. Our Rules engine is versatile and offers a large number of options  with which you can build rules including but not limited to: time, weather, Almond modes, and sensors.
</p>
<center><img src=h_build_own_scenarios.pdf/></center>
<p>
Sensors may not be automatically configured to send notifications; therefore, you will need to configure them. To do so, tap on the settings icon next to the sensor and look for notifications in the menu.
</p>
<p>You can choose one of three levels for notifications: Never, When I’m Away and Always. Each level is useful in different situations. For example, you might want to be alerted of movement in the living room only when you are away, but you might want to be alerted every time if a wall safe is opened, or a flood sensor detects water in your basement. On the other hand, you might not want to be alerted at all if a smart plug in your daughter’s room is turned on or off.
