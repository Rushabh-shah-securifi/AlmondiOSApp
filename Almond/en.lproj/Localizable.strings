To put it simply, a Scene for lights is the group of the lights you choose and whether you want them to be on or off. If one of those lights were to be flipped, your Scene is deactivated because that light is no longer in the state you chose in the Scene.Almond scenes can now be activated using Alexa. To begin using Alexa with Almond Scenes, activate the Almond skill on Alexa. For best results, rename your scene with a name from the list of suggestions that comes up. These names are easiest for Alexa to understand. Once you are done setting up the Almond skill and a Scene, you could say “Alexa, tell Almond to activate Outside Lights Off!” Where ‘Outside Lights Off’ is the name of the Scene. If you choose a name suited for use with Alexa, you will see a small Alexa icon on the Scene’s tile on the Almond app.";

"tips_homeSecurity"="Tips For Setting Up Home Security";
"tips_homeSecurity_desc"="You can secure your home with an Almond 2015, Almond+ or an Almond 3, and the appropriate security sensors. The Almond devices work best with products from Securifi, but also support a wide range of sensors from various manufacturers, listed here: https://www.securifi.com/sensors. With Almond, you can build your Home Security, using Rules and the Almond Modes: Home and Away. The Almond Mode works similar to arming and disarming your car alarm. With Almond though, you don’t need to do this yourself every time. Use our Rules engine to automate this process using WiFi Triggers.For example, you could create rules like \"If my iPhone disconnects from Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Away\" and \"If my iPhone joins Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Home\" to automatically change the mode when you leave home and when you come back. You can then add more rules, for example \"If Almond mode is Away and motion is detected, sound alarm” to harden your home against intruders while you are away, but ignore any motion events that occur when you are home.Experiment with Rules to build your own scenarios. Our Rules engine is versatile and offers a large number of components with which you can build Rules, including the time, the Almond Mode, and sensors, to make your home behave exactly as you want it to.You also need to configure the sensors to send you notifications when they are triggered, so that you are alerted when important events occur. You can choose one of three levels for notifications: Never, When I’m Away and Always.Each level is useful in different situations. For example, you might want to be alerted of movement in the living room only when you are away, but you might want to be alerted every time if a wall safe is opened, or a flood sensor detects water in your basement. On the other hand, you might not want to be alerted at all if a smart plug in your daughter’s room is turned on or off.Rules, Modes and Notifications together can help you stay in command of the situation in your home. Try building your own rules as you add more sensors to have your Smart Home respond to your needs.";


"help_topics_dashboard"="The Dashboard has been designed to help you stay up to date on the status of your Smart Home. You can see your Smart Home Sensors and Network Devices at a glance, and set your Almond to Home or Away mode with a quick tap.If you own more than one Almond, you can quickly switch between them by tapping on the device’s name above the mode control, and picking another Almond from the list.As we continue to improve Almond, and add more features, the Dashboard will be central to controlling your Smart Home. Stay tuned!";
