<center><img src=h_dashboard.pdf/></center>
<p> At a glance, you can see recent smart home and Wi-Fi device notifications, how many network and smart devices are active, and also set your Almond to Home or Away mode with a quick tap.</p>
<center><img src=h_dashboard_selectals.pdf/></center>
<p>
If you own more than one Almond, you can quickly switch between them by tapping on the device’s name above the mode control, and picking another Almond from the list.

<h3>Scenes</h3>
<p>
Scenes make controlling multiple smart devices easier and faster. For example, when you go to bed you might have two or three lights to turn off, the temperature on the thermostat to adjust, and an alarm clock to set. A scene means you can do all of them with a quick tap.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes.pdf/></center>
<p>
You can create and manage scenes from the Scenes tab in the Almond app. Tap the + button to create a scene and then tap on a device and select one or more actions from the available options. Repeat this process for as many devices as you need and then tap on “Save”. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete creating your scene.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes_action_button.pdf/></center>
<p>
To manage a scene, tap on the quick action icon to activate the scene, and tap the options icon to change the devices in the scene and rename it.
</p>
<center><img src=h_manage_scenes.pdf/></center>
<p>
A scene might appear to be active even if you haven’t activated it. That is because a scene is set to active whenever all the actions that make up that scene are turned on. For example, using the scene above, you may have decided to adjust the lights and thermostat over the course of the evening. In doing so you matched the functions in the scene and it registers as activated.
</p>
<p>
Now, Almond scenes can be activated using Alexa. To begin using Alexa with Almond scenes, activate the Almond skill on Alexa. If you are prompted to rename a scene, choose one from the list of suggestions that comes up. These names are easiest for Alexa to understand.
</p>
<center><img src=h_scenes_alexa.pdf/></center>
<p>
Once you have renamed a scene, you will see a small Alexa icon on the scene’s tile on the Almond app. When finished, to activate a scene, you could say “Alexa, tell Almond to activate Outside Lights Off!” Where ‘Outside Lights Off’ is the name of the scene.

<h3>Tips For Setting Up Home Security</h3>
<p>
With the appropriate sensors, you can use an Almond 2015, an Almond+, or an Almond 3 to create a robust and powerful DIY home security system. Almond devices support a wide range of sensors from various manufacturers including Securifi. There is a full list here: <a href=\"https://www.securifi.com/sensors\">https://www.securifi.com/sensors</a>.
</p>
<p>
With Almond, you can build your Home Security using rules and the Almond modes: Home and Away.
</p>
<center><img src=h_setting_home_security.pdf/></center>
<p>
The modes work similar to arming and disarming your car alarm or home security system. With Almond though, you don’t need to do this yourself every time. Use our rules engine to automate this process using your WiFi presence.
</p>
<center><img src=h_rules_engine.pdf/></center>
<p>
For example, you could create rules like “If Matt’s iPhone, Dana’s iPhone and Katie\’s iPod disconnect from Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Away” and “If my iPhone joins Home WiFi, set Almond mode to Home” to automatically change the mode when you and your family leave home and when you come back.
</p>
<center><img src=h_rules_automation.pdf/></center>
<p>
You can then add another rule to make sure the alarm is sounded. For example, \“If Almond mode is Away, and a door is opened, sound alarm.\”
</p><p>
Experiment with Rules to build your own scenarios. Our Rules engine is versatile and offers a large number of options  with which you can build rules including but not limited to: time, weather, Almond modes, and sensors.
</p>
<center><img src=h_build_own_scenarios.pdf/></center>
<p>
Sensors may not be automatically configured to send notifications; therefore, you will need to configure them. To do so, tap on the settings icon next to the sensor and look for notifications in the menu.
</p>
<p>You can choose one of three levels for notifications: Never, When I’m Away and Always. Each level is useful in different situations. For example, you might want to be alerted of movement in the living room only when you are away, but you might want to be alerted every time if a wall safe is opened, or a flood sensor detects water in your basement. On the other hand, you might not want to be alerted at all if a smart plug in your daughter’s room is turned on or off.

<h3>What is a Port?</h3>
<p>
A port is a gate in the processor through which data can be sent and received. Modern computing devices use ports to listen for incoming and outgoing data. Applications and services use multiple ports to send and receive data. When a port is reported as open, it is an indication that the port is being used by an application or service.  Open ports are not always a security risk, for example web server service has to have port 80 or 443 open otherwise users can not connect or configure the device. However open ports not associated with any service can be a security risk if the software they are associated with has vulnerabilities or they have not been configured properly.

<h3>What is Telnet?</h3>
<p>Telnet is a network protocol (The language used by computers to talk to each other) used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-based communications. The one thing you should know about Telnet is that it is not a secure protocol. When you log into a remote host(Camera/DVR/Computer) using Telnet for configuring or setting up the device, your username and password are sent “in the clear” – meaning, in plain text and not encrypted in any way. That means your credentials can be (relatively) easily intercepted and used to gain access to that device. For this reason (and many others) Telnet has been largely replaced by the more secure protocols.</p>

<h3>What is Port Forwarding?</h3>
<p>Port forwarding is a method of making a computer on your home network accessible to computers on the Internet (Public network), even though you are behind a router. Routers by default block access to ports on your home network devices coming from the Internet; this is an essential security feature, and prevents malicious requests from reaching your network devices. Obviously, this can also cause problems for any application that needs to communicate outside your home network since the router will just block it. This means that hosting game servers, peer to peer downloading, and voice over IP type applications will be blocked by your router. There are many other reasons you may need to forward a port, this is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p> In order to allow data to be sent from the public network to home networks, the data sender must tell the router to forward the data to a particular port in the home network. This means that when the router sees some data  destined for a specified port, it will forward it on to a specific local computer. However this process has to be done manually by the user.</p>

<h3>What is Universal Plug and Play(UPnP)?</h3>
<p>UPnP is an application that automatically forwards ports on your router. Devices like Nest Protect, X Box, and IP Cameras use UPnP to access the internet saving you the hassle of forwarding ports manually. UPnP assumes local programs are trustworthy and allows them to forward ports.</p>
<p>Routers allow you to access the internet while blocking others from accessing you. Enabling UPnP could allow a malicious program to bypass the router firewall entirely. For example, a Trojan horse could install a remote control program on your computer and open a hole for it in your router’s firewall, allowing 24/7 access to your computer from the Internet. If you don’t use applications that need port forwarding, such as game servers or VoIP programs, you may be better off disabling UPnP entirely.</p>

<h3>What is Botnet?</h3>
<p>A botnet (also known as a zombie army) is a number of computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been setup to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the Internet. Any such computer is referred to as a zombie - in effect, a computer \"robot\" or \"bot\" that serves the wishes of some master spam or virus originator. Most computers compromised in this way are home-based.</p>
<p>Computers that are coopted to serve in a zombie army are often those whose owners fail to provide effective firewalls and other safeguards. An increasing number of home users have high speed connections for computers that may be inadequately protected. A zombie or bot is often created through an Internet port that has been left open and through which a small Trojan horse program can be left for future activation. At a certain time, the zombie army \"controller\" can unleash the effects of the army by sending a single command</p>

<h3>What is Local web server?</h3>
<p>Local web server services are used to configure devices or change their settings. When configuring devices such as DVRs or Routers for the first time, you access the local web server by typing their ip address in your web browser. These web server uses port 80 to run their services. Port 80 is the standard port for websites and web servers, and it can have a lot of different security issues. These issues can allow an attacker to gain either administrative access to the website, or even the web server itself and compromise the device and your entire network as well. Therefore it’s important that you have  a very strong username and password for accessing the local web server.</p>

<h3>What is DNS?</h3>
<p>DNS is like a phone book for the Internet. If you know a person’s name but don’t know their telephone number, you can simply look it up in a phone book. DNS provides this same service to the Internet. When you visit http://securifi.com in a browser, your computer uses DNS to retrieve the website’s IP address of 52.21.61.47. Without DNS, you would only be able to visit our website (or any website) by visiting its IP address directly, such as <a href=\"http://52.21.61.47\">http://52.21.61.47</a>.</p>
<p>For devices which are compromised and participate in DDos like attacks, their DNS requests would also change. For example your ABC camera should ideally make DNS requests to abc.com, but when compromised it might start making DNS requests for other sites.like XYZ.com</p>

<h3>What is an open port and what services run on ports?</h3>
<p>
A port is considered open if it accepts all the data packets coming towards it. Similarly, a port which rejects connections or ignores all packets directed at it is called a \"closed port\".
</p>
<p>
Some of the commonly used ports and the services that run on them are as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th> Protocol</th>
<th>Port Number</th>
<th>Service Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
</td>
<td>20/21</td>
<td>
FTP is one of the most commonly used file transfer protocols on the Internet and within private networks. An FTP server can easily be set up with little networking knowledge and provides the ability to easily relocate files from one system to another
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Secure Shell (SSH)</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>SSH is the primary method used to manage network devices securely at the command level. It is typically used as a secure alternative to Telnet which does not support secure connections</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<tr>
<td>Telnet</td>
<td>23</td>
<td>Telnet is the primary method used to manage network devices at the command level. Unlike SSH which provides a secure connection, Telnet does not, it simply provides a basic unsecured connection. Many lower level network devices support Telnet and not SSH as it required some additional processing</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Domain Name System (DNS)</td>
<td>53</td>
<td>The DNS is used widely on the public internet and on private networks to translate domain names into IP addresses</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>HTTP is one of the most commonly used protocols on most networks. HTTP is the main protocol that is used by web browsers and is thus used by any client that uses files located on these servers.</td>

But the ones from 0 to 1024 are called “Well known ports” - as they are used by commonly known applications. Ports 1024 to 49151 are called registered ports and ports above 49151 to 65536 are called private ports. \n Since, application running on these ports ( 0 to 1024 ) are widely known and standardized, they are most vulnerable to hackers and unauthorised user. Furthermore, UPnP allows applications on public network to bypass router firewall and connect directly to applications running on your device. Therefore If you don’t use any such services or applications, we suggest that you disable UPnP on your Almond from the Almond App  by going to the advanced router features section of the Wifi tab.";
